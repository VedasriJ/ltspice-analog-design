# LTspice Analog Design Portfolio

This repository contains netlist-based LTspice simulations of fundamental
analog CMOS circuits developed for learning and verification of analog
integrated circuit design concepts.

The focus is on understanding:
- DC biasing and operating-point analysis
- Small-signal behavior and gain
- Frequency response and stability
- Compensation techniques in multi-stage amplifiers

All circuits are implemented using LTspice netlists and generic MOS models.
No proprietary process design kits (PDKs) are used.

## Contents

The repository is organized by circuit type. Each circuit folder contains:
- LTspice netlists
- A circuit-specific README describing the design and results
- Selected simulation plots and schematic images

Current designs include:
- Two-stage CMOS differential operational amplifier
- (More circuits to be added incrementally)

## Tools Used
- LTspice XVII
- Netlist-based SPICE simulation

## Scope and Disclaimer
- Device dimensions are chosen for educational purposes
- Designs are intended for conceptual understanding, not tape-out
- Results are qualitative and topology-focused

## How to Use
1. Navigate to a circuit folder
2. Open the netlist in LTspice
3. Run `.op` for DC bias verification
4. Run `.ac` for small-signal analysis
