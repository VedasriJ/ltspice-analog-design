# Analog Circuit Design using LTspice and HSPICE

This repository contains netlist-based LTspice simulations and HSPICE simulations of fundamental analog CMOS circuits developed for learning and verification of analog integrated circuit design concepts.

## Contents

The repository is organized by circuit type. Each circuit folder contains:
- LTspice
  - Netlists
  - A circuit-specific README describing the design and results
  - Selected simulation plots and schematic images
- HSPICE
  - Netlists
  - Selected simulation plots 
  

Current designs include:
- [Two-stage CMOS Differential Op-Amp](opamps/two_stage_opamp/README.md)
- [Common source Amplifier](opamps/common_source)
- [Common gate Amplifier](opamps/common_gate/README.md)
- (More circuits to be added incrementally)

## Tools Used
- HSPICE
- Waveform analysis is performed using Custom WaveView
- LTspice XVII
- Netlist-based SPICE simulation

## Scope and Disclaimer
- Device dimensions are chosen for educational purposes
- Designs are intended for conceptual understanding, not tape-out
- Results are qualitative and topology-focused
